Should know:
K-map
async sync(like D-filp flop)
cmos
Finite state machine
X - Fan out - fan in
X -Rc delay estimation
State table to state diagram or state diagram to state table???? then from there verilog???
or Sequence detection has given and we have to design
stack as fault?



Demultiplexer
Encoder
Decoder
JK Flip flop
Shift register(SISO, PIPO)y
Priority encoder
Bi-directional shift registor

substractor
multiplier


Memorise:
ASIC design flow
Verification stages
Logic gates
A simplified flowchart for HDL‚Äêbased modeling, verification, and synthesis(from book)
