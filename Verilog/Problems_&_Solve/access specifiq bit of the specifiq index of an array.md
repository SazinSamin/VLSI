To access the 3rd bit of the 5th index of an array in Verilog, you can use the following syntax:
y[5][3]
Assuming you have declared the array y as reg [7:0] y [7:0];, the above syntax will access the 3rd bit of the 5th index of the array.

Here's an example of how to manipulate the 3rd bit of the 5th index:

```
// Manipulating the 3rd bit of the 5th index of the array
y[5][3] = 1; // Set the 3rd bit of the 5th index to 1
```
Similarly, you can read the value of the 3rd bit of the 5th index:

```
bit_value = y[5][3]; // Read the value of the 3rd bit of the 5th index
```
Remember to ensure that the array indices and bit positions are within the declared range to avoid any out-of-bounds errors.
